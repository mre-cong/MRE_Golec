#The purpose of this script is to generate a text file that can be passed as an argument to a python file/function that then performs an MRE simulation
#The process of reading in and then utilizing the information in the text file is still in flux, and will need to be created in tandem with this file
#An additional wrapper may be created in order to generate sets of text files for simulations with well defined parameter variations
